# 4.1.3.3 允许的版本组合

Assertions of a particular major version appear only in response messages of the same major version, as
permitted by the importation of the SAML assertion namespace into the SAML protocol schema. For
example, a V1.1 assertion MAY appear in a V1.0 response message, and a V1.0 assertion in a V1.1
response message, if the appropriate assertion schema is referenced during namespace importation. But
a V1.0 assertion MUST NOT appear in a V2.0 response message because they are of different major
versions.
